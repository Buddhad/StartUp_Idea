## Shopverse: E-commerce Internet Business Plan

Popular culture is no longer regional. Today, a fashion statement in India can be seen on the streets in a small town in a matter of days thanks to the Internet. The speed of our telecommunication system has increased young customers’ expectations and demands for products that represent their own cultural statement.

### Mission
The mission of Shopverse is to offer distinctive youth-oriented fashion and products to small-town India.

### Market Analysis
The difference between Shopverse and other youth-oriented e-commerce websites is that Shopverse is focused only on India's small town customers. The target
customer is a young person, age 11-18, who watches cricket and kabaddi. Our target customer will look toward to alternative clothing trends in large urban areas as their inspiration. Shopverse will exclusively advertise in small communities. These communities already have small youth-oriented businesses, like cricket and kabaddi kit shops, that Shopverse can utilize to promote its product line.

### Financial Projections

| 3rd | $240,000 | $70,000 | $22,000 | $40,000 | $108,000 |

### Management and Success Plans
